# MSG-file-TO-CSV-extraction
This is a simple Python Script that converts MSG to CSV 

This script is very usefull in case you want to take standar fields of an MSG (via outlook mail) to extract data to CSV ( comma seperated)
It takes every single WORD and puts it in a new ,comma, seperated braket
after that you can import your csv to an excel file document.

Feel free to pull requests if you can make it to skip blank lines.

Thank you.
